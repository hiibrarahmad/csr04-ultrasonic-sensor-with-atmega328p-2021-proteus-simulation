# csr04-ultrasonic-sensor-with-atmega328p-2021-proteus-simulation
This video is about interfacing hcsr04 ultrasonic sensor with avr microcontroller atmega328p. The mcu will measure the sensor using hcsr04 and show the output on a 16x2 LCD display. This video also shows interfacing LCD display with Avr microcontroller.  Although, the same code can also be used for atmega32 and atmega8 Avr microcontrollers.  The advantage of avr microcontroller based projects is that these can be simulated on proteus and can be used in different project.
